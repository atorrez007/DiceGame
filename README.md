# Dice Game
This is a JavaScript project through Scrimba's Front-End Developer Path. <br><br>It's focused on improving on JavaScript functions and Game Logic.
I didn't really struggle with the code, mainly because I have developed a similar game on another JS course.

## Stretch Goals

Previously, the game began simply on Player-One's turn, but this would not be fair, so I created a player-turn randomizer to allow a fair chance for each roller. 

I also created a second function of the game; this was the 'Double-or-Nothing' roll. The 'Double-or-Nothing' roll allows you to gamble all your points in an effort to receive double your dice roll, however, your roll is a 50/50 chance.
